Producer supports effectful streams where effects are supported by the Eff monad.

It is inspired by the `scalaz-stream` library at least for its API.

## Installation

You add `producer` as an sbt dependency:
```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.atnos" %% "producer" % "4.0.0"

// to write types like Reader[String, ?]
addCompilerPlugin("org.spire-math" %% "kind-projector" % "0.7.1")

// to get types like Reader[String, ?] (with more than one type parameter) correctly inferred
addCompilerPlugin("com.milessabin" % "si2712fix-plugin_2.11.8" % "1.2.0")
```
